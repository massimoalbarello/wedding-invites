# The application UI decisions

This guide records durable product language and cross-feature interaction decisions that require
judgment. It is not an inventory of implemented screens or components. Shared components remain the
executable source of truth for their behavior. Read it alongside the
[frontend engineering guide](./AGENTS.md).

## Visual system

The application is one product. Consistency across routes and states takes precedence over local
novelty.

- Build generic controls and surfaces from the established shadcn/ui primitives. Do not hand-build
  a competing version of an interaction the shared system already owns.
- Use the shared theme's semantic tokens. For token or reusable variant changes, follow the
  [UI package's design contract](../../../packages/ui/AGENTS.md). Introduce application page
  patterns only for recurring distinctions with stable product meaning.
- Extend or simplify an existing primitive, component, or layout pattern before adding another.
  Keep a difference local only when it communicates a genuine product distinction.
- Use the same component for the same job. Its hover, focus, selected, disabled, loading, error, and
  editing states are part of the shared contract rather than route-specific styling.
- Prefer clear hierarchy and deliberate space over nested cards, borders, dividers, repeated
  headings, and incidental metadata.

## Detail views and editing actions

- Resource detail views share their content alignment, heading row, spacing rhythm, and top-right
  action anchor. Extend that shell when adding a resource type rather than creating another detail
  pattern.
- The shared detail-action component owns action wording, order, size, and pending state. At rest,
  `Edit {resource}` precedes lifecycle actions. Edit mode replaces the entire group with `Cancel`
  followed by `Save {resource}` at the same anchor; entering edit mode must not shift the layout.
- Resource-like management cards follow the same action contract. Values are read-only at rest;
  edit mode mounts fields in place and replaces all resting actions with `Cancel` and
  `Save {resource}`.
- Edit identity in place when the displayed and editable values are the same concept. Do not
  duplicate the value in a form card or add status decoration merely to announce edit mode.
- Tabs switch views, buttons perform actions, and links or content cards navigate. Preserve those
  distinctions visually and semantically.

## Forms and system states

- Creation surfaces share their hierarchy, field rhythm, and primary-action placement. Differences
  follow the information being requested rather than inventing a new composition.
- Ask for user intent, not technical identifiers or metadata the system can derive.
- Do not present untouched fields as erroneous. Begin required-field validation on the first submit
  attempt, then update errors as the user edits.
- Keep the primary action available before validation so it can reveal what needs attention.
  Disable it only while pending or genuinely unavailable.
- Loading, empty, missing, and recoverable error states must look intentional and offer a useful
  next action. Reserve crash-style boundaries for unexpected failures.
- Use semantic HTML and preserve labels, keyboard behavior, focus, contrast, and reduced-motion
  behavior. Shared primitives assist accessibility but do not replace manual judgment.

When an established UI pattern no longer fits, raise the conflict and decide whether the shared
pattern should change before adding a local exception.
