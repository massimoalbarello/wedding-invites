# Wedding invites

Starter for Massimo and Liza’s wedding invitation app for the ceremony on 29 June 2027.
Bootstrapped from [bun-full-stack-template](https://github.com/massimoalbarello/bun-full-stack-template)
at commit `d091a956e21f45ff91cd2baa5ebe76c4f1706fb7`.
A private passkey dashboard manages invitees, reference photos, access settings, and RSVPs.
Personal invitation links open a camera check or go directly to the invitation when bypass is enabled.
The creative invitation experience is reserved for a later iteration.
Requires Bun 1.4.0, Node 24, CMake 3.24+, and a C++ compiler. Browser journeys also need FFmpeg;
Linux builds use Docker. The first native face-engine build downloads pinned sources and models.

```sh
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bunx playwright install chromium
bun run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 and create the owner dashboard with a passkey. Only the first owner
can register; later visits use that passkey to sign in. Complete this initial setup before sharing
a deployment. Passkeys and guest camera access require localhost or HTTPS.
The owner account has no password or email recovery flow.

## Opinionated stack

These are the defaults for applications built from this template. Extend the existing owner of a
responsibility before introducing another framework; discuss a replacement when a concrete product
requirement cannot fit the established approach. Package manifests and `bun.lock` own the versions.

### Runtime and backend

| Framework or tool | What we use it for |
| --- | --- |
| [Bun](https://bun.com/) | Application runtime, workspace package management, scripts, tests, SQL access, and compilation into one executable. |
| [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) | Strict static typing across the backend, frontend, shared packages, and scripts. |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) | Runs the frontend ESLint and backend dependency checks during development and CI. |
| [Elysia](https://elysiajs.com/) | HTTP routing, request and response schemas, boundary validation, and application composition. |
| [Eden](https://elysiajs.com/eden/overview) | Gives frontend API calls types derived directly from the Elysia application. |
| [Elysia OpenAPI](https://elysiajs.com/plugins/openapi) | Generates the API specification and interactive documentation from route schemas. |
| [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/) and its [passkey plugin](https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/passkey) | Account registration, WebAuthn passkey sign-in, and cookie sessions. |

## Structure

- `apps/web/backend`: Elysia, Eden types, Better Auth passkeys, Bun SQL/SQLite, generated SQL types.
  Models own domain rules, repositories own persistence, services own workflows, routes own transport.
- `apps/web/frontend`: React, Vite, TanStack Router/Query/Form, Tailwind, Base UI/shadcn primitives.
- `packages/ui`: shared primitives and semantic theme; `packages/typescript-config`: strict TypeScript.
- `packages/build-tools`: binary verification and explicit nibrun deployment targeting.
- `packages/browser-testing`: ephemeral virtual authenticators for real WebAuthn browser tests.
- `AGENTS.md` and scoped guides: engineering judgment, ownership, trust, tests, and UI contracts.
- `.agents/skills`: feature delivery, pull request creation, and nibrun deployment workflows.

Face detection and matching run locally using OpenCV YuNet and SFace. The executable embeds the
native engine and models, while reference images, observations, and revocable guest sessions live
in the private SQLite database. A separate image-copy heuristic rejects recognizable reuse of a
reference photo; it does not establish camera liveness.

## Development and verification

```sh
bun run dev:isolated:seeded  # disposable database, real passkey signup, seeded through authenticated APIs
bun run fix:codestyle
bun run check:all
bun run test
bun run test:browser
bun --filter @repo/web test:faces
bun run build              # executable for this machine
bun run test:binary
```

`dev:isolated` opens an unseeded browser. Both isolated modes use separate ports and temporary data,
and remove only their own data on shutdown. Browser checks cover real passkey registration/sign-in,
face matching, reference-photo reuse, forwarded links, bypass settings, RSVPs, pagination, and
revocation. Screenshots go to ignored `artifacts/`. Test photography is attributed in `LICENSE`.

After editing schema or repository SQL, run `bun --filter @repo/web generate:queries` and commit the
updated generated file. CI checks generation drift, types, formatting, frontend conventions,
backend dependency boundaries, tests, compiled Linux behavior, and the real browser journey.

## Deploy to nibrun

[![Deploy your own](.github/assets/deploy-your-own.svg)](https://app.nibrun.com/deploy?name=wedding-invites&binary=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fmassimoalbarello%2Fwedding-invites%2Freleases%2Fdownload%2Fnibrun-latest%2Fapp&port=3000&minimal)

This example button creates a deployment from the `app` binary in the rolling `nibrun-latest`
GitHub prerelease. After a push to `main`, the build workflow publishes it once the Linux binary
and browser checks pass. Pull requests only build and test; publishing uses GitHub's built-in
token and needs no nibrun credentials. The release notes and tag identify the source commit.

When creating a repository from this template, change the button's `name` and URL-encoded
`binary` URL to your app name and repository, keeping `/releases/download/nibrun-latest/app`.
You can then move the button to the top of your README.
Wait for the first successful `main` build to publish the asset before using the button.
The binary URL must be publicly accessible; private repositories can use the CLI instead.

For CLI deployments, install `nib` using https://nibrun.com/install.sh and run `nib login` yourself. Then:

```sh
bun run deploy --new my-app
bun run deploy --app exact-existing-slug
```

The deploy command builds for Linux x64 and embeds the frontend, face engine, models, and migrations into
`apps/web/dist/app`. `bun run build:linux` produces the same binary without deploying it.
CI uploads the verified executable as `nibrun-binary`; no deployment credentials are required in CI.

The server honors `PORT`, listens on `0.0.0.0`, derives HTTPS origin from `NIBRUN_HOSTNAME`, and stores
SQLite and its generated private auth secret inside `/app/data`. Optional `BASE_URL` supports a
custom domain; keep the original nibrun hostname stable for existing passkeys. `DATA_FOLDER` and
`BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` can be overridden. Local defaults need no `.env` file; see `apps/web/.env.example`.

nibrun is a single VM with local persistent storage. Redeployments briefly interrupt service. Export
and verify backups before changes to persistent data; exporting is not an automatic backup schedule.
Follow [the deployment skill](.agents/skills/deploy-to-nibrun/SKILL.md) and [compatibility policy](COMPATIBILITY.md).

## Evolving the template

Use [ship-change](.agents/skills/ship-change/SKILL.md) for feature work and
[open-pull-request](.agents/skills/open-pull-request/SKILL.md) for reviewed Conventional Commit PRs.
The bootstrap application is deliberately generic; do not add a product’s integrations to the template
unless they represent a demonstrated reusable need. Preserve new lessons as executable checks where
possible and scoped guidance only when judgment is required.

Template generation copies a snapshot. Updates here do not automatically update repositories already
created from it. Adopt later improvements through focused PRs in each consuming repository, reviewing
its deployed data and local decisions. Do not overwrite a consumer’s engineering guides blindly.

Configure GitHub rulesets to require `checks:required`, `build:required`, `browser:required`, and
`check-pr-title:required` before merging, when supported by the repository’s account plan. Rulesets,
secrets, and environments are GitHub settings and are not copied by Use this template.
